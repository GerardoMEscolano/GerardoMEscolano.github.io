We establish some Lie–Trotter formulae for unital complex Jordan–Banach algebras, showing that for any elements $$a,b,c$$ in a unital complex Jordan-Banach algebra $$\mathfrak{A}$$ the identities 

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} & \left( e^{\frac{a}{n}} \circ e^{\frac{b}{n}} \right)^n = e^{a+b}, \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left( U_{e^{\frac{a}{n}}} \left(e^{\frac{b}{n}} \right) \right)^n = e^{2a +b}, \hbox{ and} \\
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} & \left(  U_{ e^{\frac{a}{n}},e^{\frac{c}{n}}} \left(e^{\frac{b}{n}} \right)\right)^n = e^{a+b+c}
\end{aligned}
$$

hold. These formulae are actually deduced from a more general result involving holomorphic functions with values in $$\mathfrak{A}$$. These formulae are employed in the study of spectral-valued (non-necessarily linear) functionals $$f: \mathfrak{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$$ satisfying $$ f(U_x(y)) = U_{f(x)}f(y)$$, for all $$x,y \in \mathfrak{A}$$. We prove that for any such a functional $$f$$,  there exists a unique continuous (Jordan-) multiplicative linear functional $$\psi: \mathfrak{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$$ such that $$f(x) = \psi(x)$$, for every $$x$$ in the connected component of the set of all invertible elements of $$\mathfrak{A}$$ containing the unit element.  If we additionally assume that $$\mathfrak{A}$$ is a JB$$^*$$-algebra and $$f$$ is continuous, then $$f$$ is a linear multiplicative functional on $$\mathfrak{A}$$. The new conclusions are appropriate Jordan versions of results by Maouche, Brits, Mabrouk, Schulz, and Touré.

We establish some Lie–Trotter formulae for unital complex Jordan–Banach algebras, showing that for any elements $a,b,c$ in a unital complex Jordan-Banach algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ the identities 
$$ \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left( \exp^{\frac{a}{n}} \circ \exp^{\frac{n}{n}} \right)^n = \exp^{a+b} $$

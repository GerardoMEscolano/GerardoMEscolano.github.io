excerpt: 'This article characterizes all bijective linear maps between certain JBW\\(^*\\)-algebras that preserve operator commutativity in both directions, showing they decompose into a central invertible scaling, a Jordan isomorphism, and a central linear term. It also analyzes additional structure when the map is symmetric, yielding self-adjoint and Jordan *-isomorphic components'

Let \\(\mathfrak{M}\\) and \\(\mathfrak{J}\\) be JBW\\(^*\\)-algebras admitting no central summands of type \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\), and let  
\\( \Phi: \mathfrak{M} \rightarrow \mathfrak{J}\\) be a linear bijection preserving operator commutativity in both directions, that is,

$$
[x,\mathfrak{M},y] = 0 \iff [\Phi(x),\mathfrak{J},\Phi(y)] = 0,
$$

for all \\(x,y \in \mathfrak{M}\\), where the associator is defined by

$$
[a,b,c] := (a \circ b) \circ c - (c \circ b) \circ a.
$$

We prove that there exist a unique invertible central element \\(z_0\\) in \\(\mathfrak{J}\\), a unique Jordan isomorphism
\\(J: \mathfrak{M} \rightarrow \mathfrak{J}\\), and a unique linear mapping \\(\beta\\) from \\(\mathfrak{M}\\) into the center of
\\(\mathfrak{J}\\) such that

$$
\Phi(x) = z_0 \circ J(x) + \beta(x), \qquad x \in \mathfrak{M}.
$$

Furthermore, if \\(\Phi\\) is symmetric (i.e., $$ \Phi(x^*) = \Phi(x)^* $$ ), then \\(z_0\\) is self-adjoint, \\(J\\) is a Jordan
\\(^*\\)-isomorphism, and \\(\beta\\) is symmetric. In addition, when \\( \mathfrak{J}\\) admits no central summands of type \\(I_1\\),
we describe all symmetric bilinear mappings whose trace is associating, and determine the form of all associating linear
maps on \\(\mathfrak{J}\\).
